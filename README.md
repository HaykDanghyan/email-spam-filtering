# Email Spam Filtering

This repository contains the implementation of an email spam filtering system using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm. The goal of this project is to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on their content.

## Overview

Spam emails are a prevalent issue that can waste user's time and potentially lead to security threats. This project tackles the problem of email spam by building a Machine Learning model using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks, and it leverages the probability theory to make predictions.
